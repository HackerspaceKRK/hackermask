# Hacker Mask

This repository contains our entry in Smogathon 2015 held in Hub:raum, Krak√≥w at 12-12-2015.

We've managed to provide a solution for generating exact fitting face mask to be cut from neoprene using 3D scan of one's face.

## Templates

Generator and example template is unfortunately missing for now.

In the mean time, you can try to source proper neoprene - not one which has unreacted polymer residues (at last does not stink), like most of Chinese smog masks. Not every material will be safe for respiratory system, we were using one intended for medical mattresses and it seemed to be OK.

## Air valve

See `zaworek-pieciakat.openscad` file.
It is prepared to be 3D-printed, you'll need to add membrane cut from not-very-thick rubber (kitchen gloves works well).

## Filters

Use Respro filters. They're lab tested, well rated and proved. Don't do them on your own.
